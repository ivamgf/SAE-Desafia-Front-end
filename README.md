# Challenge Front-End

The challenge has for objective to build a theater management application that will consume the data of an API REST.

## Instructions
The applicant is free to take the challenge with the technology he or she wishes, but we have a preference for VueJS


Imagine that you are building a public library to publish to your github, then other people have used your library, so it should contain all the necessary details in your README.MD. (Eg: How to install, How to upload, features...)

UI / UX of the application will be evaluated as if all functionalities have been implemented correctly.

The API with all its documentation is available at: http://desafia.sae.digital

1. Take the ** fork ** from this repository and create a branch with your name. (eg, marcelo-moraes).
2. After finishing the challenge, create a ** Pull Request ** with your name. (eg, marcelo-moraes).
3. Wait for some contributor to do the code review.

## Resources
Please, confirm below the features that should be implemented in the application:
  * Shows;
  * Armchairs;
  * Bill;

  
# How will we evaluate?
  * Let's upload the application and access via localhost;
  * Let's register / edit / delete / update the show;
  * We will reserve and cancel reservations for the seats;
  * Let's verify if the amount collected is accurate and correct.
